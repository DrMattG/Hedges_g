## What is Hedges g?

A central component of Evidence Synthesis is the effect size. An effect size is, quite simply, the size of the effect. It is a way to quantify the difference between two groups. The effect size is a standardised measurement of the difference between two groups (e.g. the treatment group and the control group). A simple measure of effect is the standardised mean difference (often expressed as Cohen’s d or the small-sample bias corrected version Hedges’ g). Standardised mean difference simply quantifies how much of a difference there is between the control and treatment group.

## Why do we need this App?

Standardised mean difference require the standard deviations of the two groups (control and treatment) to estimate the effect size's precision (the uncertainty) which gives us the 95% confidence limits. In many published studies the standard deviation is not reported making it difficult to calculate an effect size without making some big assumptions about the underlying data.

Often the standard error is mistakenly reported as the standard deviation, this has a big effect on the calculation of the standardised mean difference. If you calculate a very large (greater than 5) Hedges' g estimate you might want to check the calculation and the original paper to make sure that the data has been extracted correctly.
